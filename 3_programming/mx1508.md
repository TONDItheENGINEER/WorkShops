## 3. Introduction
The MX1508 utilizes an H-bridge circuit design and employs high-reliability power MOSFET technology, making it especially suitable for driving coils, motors, and other inductive loads. The internal circuitry integrates N-channel and P-channel power MOSFETs, with an operating voltage range spanning from 2V to 8V. At 27Â°C with VDD at 6.5V, when both channels are active, the 2nd channel can provide a maximum continuous output current of 0.8A and a maximum peak output current of 1.5A. The 1st channel can provide a maximum continuous output current of 1.5A and a maximum peak output current of 2.5A.

## 4. Logical Truth Table
| INAx | INBx | OUTAx | OUTBx | Function  |
|------|------|-------|-------|-----------|
|   L  |   L  |   Z   |   Z   |  Idle     |
|   H  |   L  |   H   |   L   | Forward   |
|   L  |   H  |   L   |   H   | Backward  |
|   H  |   H  |   L   |   L   | Brake     |

- Idle Mode
In idle mode, INAx=INBx=L. This includes all internal circuits, including driving power MOSFETs, being in a turned-off state. The circuit consumes very low current. At this time, the motor output terminals OUTAx and OUTBx are both in a high impedance state.

- Forward Mode
Forward mode is defined as: INAx=H, INBx=L. In this mode, the motor drive terminal OUTAx outputs a high level, and the motor drive terminal OUTBx outputs a low level. In this state, the motor drive current flows from OUTAx into the motor and from OUTBx to the ground terminal, defining the motor's rotation as forward mode.

- Reverse Mode
Reverse mode is defined as: INAx=L, INBx=H. In this mode, the motor drive terminal OUTBx outputs a high level, and the motor drive terminal OUTAx outputs a low level. In this state, the motor drive current flows from OUTBx into the motor and from OUTAx to the ground terminal, defining the motor's rotation as reverse mode.

- Brake Mode
Brake mode is defined as: INAx=H, INBx=H. In this mode, both motor drive terminals OUTAx and OUTBx output low levels, and the energy stored in the motor will be rapidly released through the NMOS gate at the OUTAx or OUTBx terminal. The motor will stop rotating in a short time. Note that in brake mode, the circuit will consume static power.

#include <Arduino.h>

  // This function will be called when the falling edge of GPIO 0 is detected.

  // Record the current time
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();

  // Check if the interrupt occurred after a debounce delay

    case 2: { // Backward sweep
      ledcWrite(1, pulseWidth++);
      ledcWrite(0, 0);

      break;

    case 3: { // Backward sweep
      ledcWrite(1, 255);
      ledcWrite(0, 255);
