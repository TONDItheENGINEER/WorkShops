Welcome to our catch-up session!  This week we will be focused on actually assembling your robot.

If you have yet to finish tasks from last week, please navigate to the respective GitHub pages and work your way through it - remember, we're all at the front if you're stuck at any stage - we’re all happy to help. 

If you’ve :

1️⃣. Made the ESP32 print Hello World
-> Your next steps : 2


2️⃣. Drove the servo motor
-> Your next steps : 3


3️⃣. Got the MX1508(Motor driver) working


Please find the wiring diagrams for  your ESP32  boards. These are color-coded and hopefully you can follow along.
