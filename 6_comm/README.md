  ## 1. Setup an AP

  </summary>

1. `void setup()` is a special function in Arduino programming that is called once when the microcontroller starts. It's used for initializing things that only need to be done once.
2. `Serial.begin(115200)` is a function call that initializes the serial communication with a baud rate of 115,200. The serial communication is a way for the microcontroller to send and receive data with an external device like a computer.
